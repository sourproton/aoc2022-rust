# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust, by sourproton

My attempt to solve the [AoC2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) with the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Usage

### Dependencies

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

### Installation

- clone this repository
- `cd` to it
- test it with `cargo test`. It should perform all tests and display `test result: ok` with `0 failed`
- compile with `cargo build --release`

### Usage

- Download **your** inputs for each puzzle and replace those in the `data/inputs/` folder. Respect the naming convention with 2 digits for the days: `input01.txt`, `input02.txt`, `inputXX.txt`, ...
- To run all solutions, run `cargo run --release`
- To run the solutions to days `X`, `Y` and `Z`, run `cargo run --release -- X Y Z`

## Why

The Advent of Code is a great challenge to learn and apply programming skills. My goal is to learn new algorithms and develop code organization and project management.

Rust is a modern, general-purpose programming language that features *memory safety*. I'm particularly interested in this feature and that's the reason I'm learning to code in Rust.
